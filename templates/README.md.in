## Introduction ##

Many years ago, John Gruber wrote a [Perl script] to apply title case rules to
text.  It was interesting, but I didn't have much use for it at the time.
Subsequently, it was [improved] by Aristotle Pagaltzis.  Again, I didn't need
it.

When I created MultiMarkdown Composer, however, applying title case
automatically to headers seemed like a useful feature.  Perl didn't help me,
though, and I ended up discovering Marshall Elfstrand's [Objective-C] version.
This allowed me to incorporate the functionality directly (once I fixed a
couple of bugs).

I finally decided that it was time for a proper c implementation to make the
algorithm more portable.


## Use ##

cTitleCase can be used in two ways:

1. As a library (`libTitleCase`) in your own program.  You use either
`title_case_string()` or `title_case_string_len()` depending on whether you
know the string's length or not.  Free the resulting string when you're
finished with it.

2. As a command line program (`titlecase`).  It can accept a title from the
command line or from `stdin`.  It can only accept a single line of text.

	* `titlecase "this is a title"`
	* `titlecase < title_file.txt`


I included the [test examples] that Aristotle Pagaltzis compiled (includes John
Gruber's original test examples), and it passes all of them.


## Development ##

This is a new implementation.  I use `re2c` to create a tokenizer that
recognizes words of different types, as well as punctuation that starts sub-
sentences and sub-phrases.  The program then walks through the tokens to
determine how to modify each word.

It's a relatively simple program, but still may contain bugs.  If you discover
any, please let me know.

That said, this program is not going to work perfectly for every title.  It's
limited to English.  Your mileage may vary....
